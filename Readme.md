## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### The repository

First, you will need to `clone` or `fork` the repository into your Github account:

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg" alt="Fork on GitHub" width='450'>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mimians/nft-market-swap.git
```

### Installing

First cd into directory, you will need to install the dependencies with: `npm install`.

Run the following command in your terminal after cloning the main repo:

```
$ npm install
```

Then, you will need to install Truffle globally by running the following command int your terminal:

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

### Running the Tests

First, you will have to compile the smart contracts by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ truffle compile
```

Then you will have to install and run Ganache to run your blockchain locally:

https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache

Then, the tests that validate your solution can be executed by runing the following
command:

```
$ truffle test
```

### Deployment on Local Blockchain

Deploy the contracts on your Ganache local blockchain by running the following command:

```
$ truffle migrate --reset
```

### Opening the User Interface

First of all, it is required that you install Metamask wallet as a browser extension: https://metamask.io/

Then you should configure Metamask to connect to your local blockchain run by Ganache. This requires the following:
- Open Metamask
- Open the Network Configuration panel
- Open Custom RPC
- Configure your private network by adding `http://localhost:7545` on the URL and `1337` as a chain ID.
- Import the first Ganache Account to Metamask by copying the Account Private Key from Ganache and pasting it on Metamask

Finally you just need to run the following command in your terminal to open the User Interface:

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## The Project

This project consists of an open platform where each user can mint his own NFT and expose it on a marketplace by making an offer or buying NFT from others. It includes:

- A smart contract which represents a collection of NFTs by following the ERC-721 standard
- A smart contract which represents the NFT Marketplace and contains all the logic to make offers, fill offers...
- Tests build with JavaScripts to ensure smart contracts are accomplishing the expected functionalities
- A React.js front-end application for a responsive user interface for both web and mobile

### Project architecture

<img src="./img/architecture.PNG" alt="architecture">

The user can access the application via web-browser, and he must have the Metamask wallet installed. This interface, built with React.js, relies on the web3.js library to communicate with the smart contracts through Metamask. This means that the data reflected on the front-end application is fetched from the blockchain. Each action performed by the user (mint a NFT, offer NFT, buy NFT...) creates a transaction on blockchain, which will require Metamask confirmation and pay a small gas fee, and this transaction will permanently modify the state of the NFTCollection and NFTMarketplace smart contracts. On top of it, the user will upload the NFT Metadata to the IPFS, creating a permanent hash which will be permanently recorded on the blockchain itself to prove ownership.

### NFT Marketplace features

<img src="./img/layout.PNG" alt="layout">

The user can perform the following actions on this NFT Marketplace:

#### Mint

The user must input a name, description and upload a file (image) to mint his own NFT. Once minted, a representation of this NFT will be displayed in the marketplace and initially it will be owned by its creator. This is open for everyone, meaning everyone can participate in this NFT creation. 

#### Make Offer

The user can offer his NFT by specifying its price. If someone fulfills this offer, then the NFT ownership is transferred to a new owner. 

#### Cancel Offer

The user can cancel an offer he did in the past if in the end he does not want to sell his NFT or wants to adjust the price.

#### Buy

A user can buy those NFT which someone else offered for sale in the marketplace. This will require paying the requested price (the ETH will be transferred to the smart contract to be claimed later on).

#### Claim Funds

If a user sold an NFT, he can claim his funds by clicking the button in the top-right.
